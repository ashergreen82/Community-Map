2. For the example community: `https://www.communitysaleevents.com/admin/sales?communityId=eef06da4-788b-435b-8f84-9467dd5b89a9`

## Important Notes
- You must be logged in to access the admin pages
- Only authorized users can edit garage sales for a community
- Changes are saved automatically when you click "Save" or "Update"
- The QR code always directs to the public map view first for security reasons

## Troubleshooting
- **Can't see the admin option?** Make sure you're logged in with an account that has admin privileges
- **Page not loading?** Check that you've typed the URL correctly
- **Can't edit sales?** Verify you have the proper permissions for that community
