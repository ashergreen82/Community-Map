# [Community Map Project](https://community-map-207215937730.us-central1.run.app/)

## Overview
When I first moved into the Bay Ridges area a few years ago, I was delighted to find a flyer advertising the yearly community garage sales event.  I was excited and looked forward to going for a walk that lovely summer day and get a chance to meet my neighbours. The flyer had a map on it showing where all the garage sales were located.  I had my cellphone in one had, and the paper map in the other hand, and I thought to myself, well, this is stupid, why can't we have an app that maps out all the garage sales?  My neighbour, Jamie, agreed with me, and so we decided to make a website that would allow the organizers to enter in each of the sales and map them out on google maps.

## Main Objective
We have successfully managed to reach our goal of having a website that allows the organizers to enter in each of the sales and map them out on google maps.  We would like some help from you to get your opinions on work flow and design elements to make this a polished website.

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Go to https://community-map-207215937730.us-central1.run.app/ to view the website, and we look forward to hearing your feedback.

## Future Objectives
Our next goals are as follows:
- We want to add a the ability for user to add community sales to their their calendars (we'll start with google calendar)
- We want to create a way for anyone who has a single garage sale to be able to add it to the website, So that all garage sales in a particular area (even within a city) can be mapped out on google maps, allowing people to go from sale to sale throughout the day.
- We want to create a way for users to be able to search for garage sales in a particular area.
- We want to create a way for users to be able to filter garage sales by date, land location
- If there are any other features that you think would be helpful, please let us know.
